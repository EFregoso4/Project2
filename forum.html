    <h2>What is the PRIVACY Forum?</h2>
    <p>The PRIVACY Forum includes emailed messages and associated materials (along with an archive including some of these items) for the discussion and analysis of issues relating to privacy (both personal and collective) in the information age. Topics include telecommunications, information and database collection and sharing, and a wide range of other privacy issues, as pertains to the privacy concerns of individuals, groups, businesses, government, and society at large.</p>

    <p>The PRIVACY Forum is supported in part by the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Committee on Computers and Public Policy.</p>
    <p>The goal of the PRIVACY Forum is to present a useful resource for both individuals and organizations.</p>
